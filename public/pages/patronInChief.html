                        Islam is a religion of humanity. It should therefore be propagated in each and every corner of the world. Islam is not only a religion; rather, it is a way of life which tells you how to go about your daily affairs. It is the religion that was taught by every Prophet of Allāh the Almighty (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon them all). The Holy Qur’ān is the last book and the Holy Prophet Sayyiduna Muhammad (PBUH) is the final Messenger of Allāh. The Prophethood came to an end after the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and the sacred message of Islam was spread and continues to be spread by all his devoted followers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Muslims have always had a great attachment to missionary activities from the beginning of Islam wherever they went and in whatever capacity they went, they were the prime missionaries of Islam. When they went to Persia, Africa, Europe and India in a wave of conquests they were first missionaries, and then soldiers. In the later years when the Muslim world split into various independent units (due to conspiracies of anti-Islamic elements), the rulers of these units were not as sincerely attached to Islam as they were to their own ego for power and worldly gain. Only due to devout missionaries, the spiritual conquest of Islam continued uninterrupted. History bears witness to the uncountable servants and spiritual luminaries who continued to carry the sacred message of Islam throughout the world. We, therefore, see that many countries in the world such as Indonesia, Malaysia and many parts of Africa were under the banner of Islam not by conquest but by the constant efforts of the devotees of Islam. Amongst these saints and servants of Islam, were the likes of Shaikh Abdul Qadir-Al-Jillani, Mujjadid Alf-Sani Hazrat Shaikh Ahmed Farooqi Sarhandi, Shaikh Data Ali-Hujweri, Shaikh Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and many other Sufi saints, mystical teachers and philosophers who have made historical contributions to the cause of Islam. One of such great personalities in our age is Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Naqshbandi (very well known to his spiritual disciples by the name of Mehboob Sajjan Sain).

                    HIS BIRTH
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Indus valley of Sindh has produced many prominent Shaikhs and mystical teachers, one of them being Sajjan Sain. He belongs to the very famous clan named 'Abbasi Quraishi'. This family is famous for its religious activities and many Shaikhs were born to this family. His Eminence was born on 21 March 1963, in the house of Al-Hajj Allāh Bakhsh (Sohna Sain) at Rehmat Pur Sharif in Sindh. His forefathers lived in the North of Sindh in Khanwan, which is near Kandiyaro City.

                    His Education
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Before I go on to explaining his educational achievements, it is important to understand education in the Muslim family. In European and Non-Muslim countries, children are trained in modern education systems and that is as far as the road reaches. However, in the Muslim family, more stress is given to the religious education as Muslims believe that their lives should be spent for the cause of our Lord Allāh the Almighty. Therefore, Sajjan Sain, when he was of the age of seven years, completed his basic recitation of the Holy Qur'ān. The recitation of the Holy Qur'ān is the basic and beginning of education in any Muslim family. Although for some Muslims, their Islamic education begins and ends with the recitation of the Qur'ān, fortunately, Sajjan Sain had a very learned, pious and spiritual father who was keen to train his beloved son in all Islamic sciences. Therefore, Sajjan Sain was sent to Madrasa Ruknul Islam, Hyderabad in 1969-70, where he learned the sciences of the recitation of the Holy Qur'ān: Tajweed and Qirat (phonetic techniques and pronunciation of the letters of the Holy Qur'ān).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many scholars and teachers who could teach him, but his father urged to send him to the most expert teacher in the above mentioned science of the Holy Qur’ān: Ustaadh-Ul-Qurra Maulana Al-Hajj Tufail Naqshbandi from Hyderabad. He is the teacher who His Eminence Sajjan Sain was sent to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After acquiring basic training in the recitation and pronunciation of the Holy Qur’ān, he started learning many languages, which include Persian and Arabic. Alongside this, he learnt many theological sciences which include:
                </p>
                <ul>
<li>Sarf and Nahu (Arabic Grammar)</li>
<li>Tarjuma and Tafseer (Translation and exegesis of the Holy Qur'ān)</li>
<li>Hadith (Talks and practical demonstrations of the Holy Prophet PBUH)</li>
<li>Fiqh (Islamic Law and Jurisprudence)</li>
<li>Ilmul-Kalaam (Fundamentals of Belief System and their philosophy)</li>
<li>Mantiq (Logic)</li>
<li>Falsafa (Philosophy)</li>
<li>Balagha (Eloquence)</li>
<li>Munazira (Science of Debate)</li>
<li>Adabul-Arabi (Arabic Literature)</li>
<li>Tareekh (History)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition to all the above theological sciences; he proceeded to acquire deeper knowledge of Tafseer, Hadith and Fiqh which are called respectively Usool-e-Tafseer, Usool-e-Hadith and Usool-e-Fiqh. Here, the principles and philosophies of these sciences are taught in more detail so that the student can provide an explicit explanation and interpretation. He was taught and trained in the above mentioned Islamic theological sciences at Jamiah Arabia Ghaffaria, Allāhabaad Shareef, Kandiyaro, Sindh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His father himself was a famous Sufi teacher of the Indus Valley who had thousands of books in his private library, and would speak about opinions, ideas and philosophies of different thinkers, and compare teachings of many great scholars. This scholarly atmosphere motivated the young Sajjan Sain to move far away from his parents and to search for a theologian who could be taken as an authority in the field of theological sciences. He therefore was introduced to a great Shaikh and scholar of his time: Shaikh-Ul-Hadith Muntakhibul Haq Qadri, who received this spiritual son of a spiritual leader with great love and affection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sajjan Sain struggled day and night and did not leave any stone unturned to gain knowledge from his great teacher. The generosity of his teacher had benefited him a lot in the field of knowledge. He had acquired sound knowledge and was thus permitted by his great teacher to convey and spread this knowledge to humanity. He completed his Dars-e-Nizami (the higher degree in theological sciences in Indo-Pak) in 1982 AD/1402 A.H. A traditional feast was arranged at Kandiyaro for thousands of people when he completed his theological knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To guide humanity in the modern world, it is necessary for every leader, may he be a spiritual teacher or a political leader, to have knowledge of modern sciences and discoveries. Therefore, Sajjan Sain studied tirelessly, reading current magazines on modern discoveries, having discussions with professors and doctors until His Eminence reached a level of significant understanding of the respective fields.
