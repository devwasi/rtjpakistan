                            Sajjan Saeen, real name (Khawaja) Muhammad Tahir Bakhshi Naqshbandi. He was born on March
                            21st 1963, in District Larkana, Pakistan. He belongs to the Mujaddidi branch of the
                            Naqshbandi Sufi order. His spiritual lineage goes back to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
                            through Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi, the Mujjadid of the eleventh Hijri century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The message and teachings of Sajjan Sain are straightforward to understand. He says that one
                            should consider their actions and exert effort in bettering oneself. One should not object
                            not to speak ill of any other being, religion or sect. He teaches to work for the prosperity
                            of Islam, other beings and bettering one's character. One should not use their power or
                            resources to hurt others; instead, they should be like a river, silently benefitting others.
                            He teaches and insists on practising the remembrance of God in one's heart (Zikr Qalbi).
                            This method helps one strengthen their bond with Allah the Almighty. He often advises
                            following the practice (Sunnah) of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) as well as encouraging his
                            students to recite and understand the Holy Quran, which will, in turn, allow them to love
                            all the creation of Allah and His Holy Prophet's (PBUH) happiness. His emphasis is to purify
                            one's soul and to achieve closeness to Almighty Allah.

                                    to come out of the “rat race”. Helping in taking start-ups, conducting business

                                    Social welfare is concerned with welfare and well-being of the poor, vulnerable and
                                    marginalized segments of society. This excluded population has fewer opportunities
                                    for economic, social, and human development, and remains caught in a vicious cycle
                                    of poverty; therefore, economic growth needs to be equitable for improving the
                                    living standards of all strata of the society.
